## Rotten Oranges : 

Given a grid of dimension nxm where each cell in the grid can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:
0 : Empty cell
1 : Cells have fresh oranges
2 : Cells have rotten oranges

We have to determine what is the minimum time required to rot all oranges. A rotten orange at index [i,j] can rot other fresh orange at indexes [i-1,j], [i+1,j], [i,j-1], [i,j+1] (up, down, left and right) in unit time.
